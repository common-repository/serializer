Allows you to serialize your AutoPlay Media Application for online activatation and customer management.

== Description ==

To use the wordpress plugin simply go to your plugins page on your wordpress site, select Plugins>Install>Upload and upload the serializer.zip file. Press install then activate.  You will see a new serials menu on the left in your wordpress menu.  The Serials main page will show you any serials you have available and if they are active. You can see who they registered to and also have the ability to set serials as purchased so you don’t sell the same serial twice.  In each users profile will also be a list of any serials purchase. Serials must be activated through the software but can be deactivated for transfer in the users profile or directly from the software.  In order for the wordpress plugin to activate the files the user must provide a valid email address that is registered to your site and a valid serial number. 

You will also need the serializer AutoPlay Plugin which is available for free as well. Visit <a href="http://www.scriptonite.net/?p=134">Scriptonite.net</a> for more help and example files.
